# **App Name**: Space Survivor

## Core Features:

- Score Tracking: Tracks the player's score, incrementing by one for each enemy converted into a star.
- Player Lives: The player starts with three lives, losing one upon collision with an enemy shot. The game ends when lives reach zero.
- Enemy Conversion: The player converts enemy by shooting. Enemies are defeated after the adequate amount of collisions with player shots.
- Boss Opponent: After converting the initial enemies, a more powerful boss opponent (pentagon) appears with twice the movement speed.
- HUD Display: Displays the current score and remaining lives in a persistent HUD list onscreen.
- Win/Lose Condition: The game displays a 'you win' screen if the final boss is defeated with lives remaining, or a 'game over' screen if lives are depleted.
- Player Movement: Enable keyboard and touchscreen support for player movement and firing mechanics.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep space purple (#4A306D) to evoke a cosmic atmosphere.
- Background color: Dark gray (#222222) to provide contrast and enhance visibility of game elements.
- Accent color: Electric blue (#7DF9FF) to highlight interactive elements and scores.
- Font: 'Space Grotesk', a sans-serif font, for a modern and slightly technical look. Perfect for both headlines (titles) and shorter amounts of text in the game HUD.
- Simple, geometric icons for representing player lives and power-ups, aligning with the game's minimalist aesthetic.
- Clean, full-screen layout with a focus on the central gameplay area. Score and lives are displayed in a corner for easy access.
- Subtle animations for enemy spawning, star conversions, and the boss appearance to enhance player feedback without distraction.
